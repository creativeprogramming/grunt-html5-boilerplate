Grunt HTML5 Dev Boilerplate
---------------------------

The Grunt HTML5 Dev Boilerplate is a readymade package to kickstart the frontend development process.

As my personal boilerplate option, it's stripped down to my favorite tools of trade - Boostrap 3 and LESS on the CSS side, CoffeeScript and jQuery on the JS side. 

It utilizes the basic modernizr download to provide backward compatibility and polyfills.

Installation
------------

1. Clone the contents of this repository to a directory.
2. Install the dependencies with "npm install"
3. Fire up the server with "grunt server" and automatic LESS/CS compilation with "grunt watch"
4. ???
5. Profit.

Structure
---------

1. "/static" contains the content ready to be served by server
2. "/src" contains content that needs processing
